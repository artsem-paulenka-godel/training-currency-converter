# Quickstart: Favorite Currencies

## Goal

Let users mark up to five currencies as favorites and see them at the top of both selectors, with favorites persisted in localStorage.

## Steps

1. Open the currency converter page.
2. Select a currency in either selector.
3. Use the Favorite toggle next to the selector to add or remove the current currency.
4. Confirm favorites appear at the top of both selectors.
5. Add up to five favorites; attempt a sixth to see the limit message.
6. Refresh the page and confirm favorites persist when localStorage is available.
7. Repeat the toggle flow using keyboard only and confirm visible focus and equivalent behavior.

## Notes

- If localStorage is unavailable, favorites remain for the current session only and the UI displays a non-persistent-state message.
